# bola-zoga

This is a project created by me, Wesley Morrison, and Alicia Hill in December 2017 - May 2018. I acted as UI designer and created the majority of UI features including the main menu, pause system, and collection system.
This project is a 1 player strategy PC game where users play as a ball and collect objects before reaching the target at the end of each course. This game is played with a mouse and keyboard.
